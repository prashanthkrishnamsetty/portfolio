### Description

 
- Collaborated with Finance Professor to design, develop, and implement azure-based data pipelines that supported the acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis of financial data and utilized azure data factory to create automated ETL workflows, enabling the seamless integration of financial data from diverse sources, such as market feeds, trading platforms, and economic indicators.
- Engineered data transformation processes using Azure Databricks and SQL to cleanse, transform, and enrich raw financial data, ensuring accuracy and consistency for quantitative analyses.
- Developed comprehensive work plans, adeptly managing deadlines and orchestrating project teams and sub-teams to ensure the successful completion of data projects.
- Played a pivotal role in the project cycle plan for the data warehouse, encompassing source data analysis, data extraction, transformation, and the design of ETL loading strategies.
- Produced detailed mapping spreadsheets for the ETL team, streamlining data transformation through the provision of source-to-target mapping, naming standards, data types, volumetric information, domain definitions, transformation rules, and corporate metadata definitions.

<!-- - Developed and maintained data pipelines, ensuring the seamless flow of data from source systems to data warehouses for analysis and reporting.
- Implemented ETL processes to clean, transform, and load large datasets, enhancing data quality and making it ready for analysis.
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover hidden insights within complex datasets and identify patterns that informed data engineering decisions.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams to design and optimize data architecture, resulting in more efficient data storage and improved data accessibility for analysis.
- Employed statistical techniques and machine learning models to derive actionable business insights, contributing to data-driven decision-making.
- Designed and created interactive data visualizations and dashboards using tools like Tableau or Power BI to present analytical results effectively.
- Worked on data migration projects, ensuring a smooth transition of data between systems while minimizing downtime and data loss.
- Utilized cloud platforms like AWS to set up scalable and cost-effective data infrastructure, supporting both data engineering and analysis needs.
- Automated routine data engineering tasks, saving time and reducing the risk of errors, allowing for faster data delivery to analysts. -->
